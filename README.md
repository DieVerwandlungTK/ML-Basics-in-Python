# OBJECTIVE
- To implement the Machine Learning algorithm that I learned theoretically in lectures
- To learn the implementation of the Machine Learning framework (such as PyTorch)

# EXAMPLES
- example1.py: an example of binary class classification by a (single-layer) perceptron
- example2.py: an example of multi class classification by a (single-layer) perceptron

# DETAILS
## utils
Provides various utilities

### data
Provides DataLoader base-class and other utility classes

## models
Provides models that inherit from "Model" class in model.py
